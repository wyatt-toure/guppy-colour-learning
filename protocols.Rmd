## Overview 

This page contains detailed protocols for the experiments in 'Colour biases in
learned foraging preferences in Trinidadian guppies'. We provide step by step
instructions on how to perform the training, testing, and behavioural
quantification described in the manuscript. If you would like to see details on
housing and husbandry conditions during the experiment please refer to section 2
of the manuscript.

For this project, we wanted to determine whether object preferences were plastic
for both green and blue objects in Trinidadian guppies. Given these colours
differ in their foraging relevancy for guppies we wanted to determine whether
the shift in preference would be unconstrained. Our protocol aimed to manipulate
object preferences for the green and blue objects (Figure
\@ref(fig:experiment-2-objects)) of individual guppies by manipulating their
foraging experiences with these objects. This was done by providing food
reinforcement for approaching one of the two colours.

On the first trial, guppies were placed in the test tank with both objects but
empty food strips to measure initial preferences. Training then occurred once
daily between 10h00 to 16h00 for 20 days constituting 20 trials. During
training, the location of the rewarding object (left or right) was randomized
across days and individuals. That is, only the object’s appearance provided a
reliable cue to food location. On the 21st day, an unreinforced ‘probe’ test was
given where new duplicates of the objects were presented with empty plastic
strips attached to them. This unreinforced trial (trial 21) was used to assess
whether learning had occurred. In experiment 2 an additional four test trials
were conducted to see how robust learning was in both groups across different
contexts.

## Tests trials 

For the initial test and final tests (Probe 1, Probe 2, G1, G2, and Odour)
guppies were presented with the green and blue objects with empty food strips
attached to them. You can see an example of this above. The following protocol
was used for testing:

1.  Fill the test tank with water from several home tanks to the 8 cm line.
2.  Transfer the guppy from the home tank to the test tank via a white opaque
    plastic cup where the green and blue objects had already been placed with
    new and blank plastic food strips.
3.  Allow guppies to acclimate in a 20 cm tall, open-ended glass holding
    cylinder (7 cm diameter) after being transferred into the test tank for 120
    seconds.
4.  After acclimation lift the release glass was lifted and give guppies 5
    minutes to move about the tank and feed from the objects. At this point the
    experimenter leaves the room.
5.  After 5 minutes the guppy is transferred back to the home tank via the white
    opaque plastic cup.
6.  Repeat steps 2 to 5 for all guppies.

## Training and refresher trials

Guppies were rewarded for foraging from either the blue object or the green
object, forming the two experimental treatments, blue-rewarded and
green-rewarded. The food reward was a gelatin mixture of flake food which was
placed on the back of the objects facing away from the guppy so that the
rewarding object had to be approached and investigated for the food reward to be
discovered. To see how to make the food reward go to [Food
strips](#food-strips). The protocol was as follows:

1.  Fill the test tank with water from several home tanks to the 8 cm line.
2.  Transfer the guppy from the home tank to the test tank via a white opaque
    plastic cup where the green and blue objects have already been placed into
    the test tank. The objects should be placed on their designated velcro piece
    which are each 6 cm from the side of the tank with one on the left and right
    end of the tank. The two objects are 38 cm apart.
3.  Dip the food strip in some water to remove excess flakes. Keep dipping until
    the strip does not shed flakes upon being dipped in water (about 8 to 10
    dips)
4.  Attach a food strip to the back of the correct rewarding object for that
    trial using blunt tweezers. Consult the data sheet to confirm which guppy is
    rewarded to which object and which side of the tank the rewarding object
    should be placed.
5.  Gently pour the guppy into a 20 cm tall, open-ended glass holding cylinder
    (7 cm diameter). Allow the guppy to acclimate in the holding cylinder
    for 120 seconds.
6.  After acclimation the release glass should be slowly lifted and the guppies
    given 5 minutes to move about the tank and feed from the objects. Set a
    timer for 5 minutes and 20 seconds and leave the room once you have lifted
    the cup. Come back after 5 minutes and 20 seconds.
7.  Stop the video recording using the remote.
8.  Transfer the guppy back to the home tank via the white opaque plastic cup.
9.  Repeat steps 3 to 8 for all guppies.

### Food strips

The food strips that were attached to the objects were made with the following
protocol:

1.  Pour 50 mL of conditioned water into a 100 mL beaker.
2.  Add a serving of decapsulated brine shrimp egg to the water and stir then
    add a pinch of Tetramin flake food and stir.
3.  Add a packet of Knox gelatin to the water and stir for about 15 seconds or
    until the powder fully dissolves, then wait another 15 seconds.
4.  Use a transfer pipette to transfer the food mixture from the beaker onto 1.5
    cm x 0.5 cm (*w* x *h*) strips of plastic.
5.  Spread another pinch of flake food on top of the food mixture on the plastic
    strips while it is still wet.
6.  Wait one hour for food to fix onto the plastic strips.

## Objects 

```{r experiment-2-objects, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="(A) The two objects used in experiment 1. Blue-trained guppies were trained to the left object and green-trained guppies were trained to the right object. The manufacturer’s colour name for the blue object is ‘dark azur (hex #078BC9) and for the green object is ‘bright yellowish green’ (hex # BBE90B). (B) The 7 pairs of objects in experiment 2. Object pairs 1,2,3,4, and A had the same colour properties as the object pair used in experiment 1. The bricks for the generalization objects were 'dark green' (hex #237841) and 'bright blue' (#0055BF) as specified by the manufacturer. The numbered object pairs are used for training while the lettered object pairs are used for testing. The experimental timeline represents the order of the trials. Experiment 1 ends at trial 21."}

## EthoVision behavioural quantification 

We quantified behaviour throughout this project using [EthoVision
XT 11.5](https://www.noldus.com/ethovision-xt). Below are the instructions that
were given to an undergraduate student (Mina Araya-Yohannes) tasked with
conducting experimental trials, and collecting as well as quantifying
behavioural data for a large portion of experiment 2 trials. While EthoVision is
proprietary software, we reproduce our protocol for using it in this experiment
