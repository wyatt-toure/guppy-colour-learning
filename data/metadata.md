### Experiment 2 Metadata

Variable descriptions for `colour-learning-experiment-2-full-data.csv`

`ate`	
: Whether a guppy ate during the trial or not

`id`	
: The individual ID of a guppy

`object.pair`	
: The identity of the object pair used during the trial

`object.side`	
: The side of the tank the rewarding object was placed on (relative to the
experimenter's perpsective) during the trial

`trial`	
: The trial number

`distance.moved`	
: The distance moved (centimeters)

`mean.velocity`	
: The mean velocity (centimeters per second)

`periphery.visits`	
: The number of times a guppy came within the periphery of the tank

`time.in.periphery`	
: The amount of time spent in the periphery of the tank (seconds)

`latency.to.periphery`	
: The time it took for a guppy to first approach the periphery of the tank
(seconds). Dashes represents no visit. 0 indiciates an immediate visit (i.e. as
soon as the tracking began)

`center.visits`	
: The number of times a guppy came within the center of the tank

`time.in.center`	
: The amount of time spent in the center of the tank (seconds)

`latency.to.center`	
: The time it took for a guppy to first approach the center of the tank (seconds).
Dashes represents no visit. 0 indiciates an immediate visit (i.e. as soon as the
tracking began)

`left.object.visits`	
: The number of times a guppy came within 4 cm of the object placed on the left
side of the tank

`time.with.left.object`	
: The amount of time a guppy spent within 4 cm of the object placed on the left
side of the tank (seconds)

`left.object.latency`	
: The time it took for a guppy to first come within 4 cm of the object placed on
the left side of the tank (seconds). Dashes represents no visit. 0 indiciates an
immediate visit (i.e. as soon as the tracking began)

`right.object.visits`	
: The number of times a guppy came within 4 cm of the object placed on the right
side of the tank

`time.with.right.object`	
: The amount of time a guppy spent within 4 cm of the object placed on the right
side of the tank (seconds)

`right.object.latency`	
: The time it took for a guppy to first come within 4 cm of the object placed on
the right side of the tank (seconds). Dashes represent no visit. 0 indiciates an
immediate visit (i.e. as soon as the tracking began)

`rewarding.object.colour`	
: The colour of object a guppy was trained to

`reward.object.side`	
: The side of the tank the rewarding object was placed on (relative to the
camera's perpsective which is inverted from the experimenter's perspective)
during the trial

`time.with.trained.object`	
: The amount of time a guppy spent within 4 cm of the object they were trained to
(seconds). In the paper we refer to this as the rewarded object

`time.with.untrained.object`	
: The amount of time a guppy spent within 4 cm lengths of the object they were not
trained to (seconds). In the paper we refer to this as the unrewarded

`green.object.preference`	
: The relative preference for the green object (seconds)

`rewarding.object.preference`	
: The relative preference for the rewarding object (seconds)

`prop.rewarding.object.preference`	
: The proportional prefernce for the rewarding object

`time.with.both.objects`	
: The time spent within 4cm of both objects

`total.time`	
: The total time the guppy was tracked for. Derived by summing the time in
periphery and time in center

`trial.type`	
: The type of trial that was conducted (training, test, or refresher)

`training.feeding.count`	
: The number of training trials (refresher excluded) for which that guppy ate
