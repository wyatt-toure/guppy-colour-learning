## Summary

This is the repository containing all the code to produce the analyses and
figures in the manuscript ‘Colour biases in learned foraging preferences in
Trinidadian guppies’. A reader-friendly website which walks through each of the
models in the manuscript is available at
<https://wyatt-toure.github.io/guppy-colour-learning/>.

## How to reproduce the results

This project uses the
[`renv`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html) package from RStudio
to manage package dependencies and ensure reproducibility through time. To
ensure results are reproduced based on the versions of the packages used at the
time this project was created you will need to install `renv` using
`install.packages("renv")` in RStudio.

If you want to reproduce the results it is best to download the entire
repository onto your system. This can be done either by clicking the green code
button on GitHub and then clicking Download ZIP or from the command line using
`git clone https://github.com/wyatt-toure/guppy-colour-learning`.

Once the repository is downloaded onto your system, navigate to the root
directory and open `guppy-colour-learning-project.Rproj`. It is important to
open the project using the `.Rproj` file to ensure the working directory is set
correctly. Then install the package dependencies onto your system using
`renv::restore()`. Running `renv::restore` will install the correct versions of
all the packages needed to replicate our results. Packages are installed in a
stand-alone library for this project, and will not affect your installed R
packages anywhere else.

If you want to reproduce specific result from the analyses you can open either
`analysis-experiment-1.Rmd` for results from experiment 1 or
`analysis-experiment-2.Rmd` for results from experiment 2. You can select the
Run All option under the Code option in the navbar of RStudio to execute all the
code chunks. You can also run all chunks independently as well though we advise
that you do so sequentially since variables necessary for the analysis are
created as the script progresses.

## Directory structure

- `data/` contains the raw data used to conduct the analyses
- `docs/` contains the reader-friendly html write-up of the analyses, the GitHub pages site is built from this folder
- `R/` contains custom R functions used in the analysis
- `figs/` contains the individual files for the figures and residual diagnostic plots produced by the analysis script 
- `images/` contains relevant images and videos of the experiment

The root directory contains all the Rmd scripts used to conduct the analyses and
render the website.

The R code for the analysis can be found in
[`analysis-experiment-1.Rmd`](https://github.com/wyatt-toure/guppy-colour-learning/blob/main/analysis-experiment-1.Rmd)
for the experiment 1 analysis and
[`analysis-experiment-2.Rmd`](https://github.com/wyatt-toure/guppy-colour-learning/blob/main/analysis-experiment-2.Rmd)
for the experiment 2 analysis.

The protocols page is built from the
[methods.Rmd](https://github.com/wyatt-toure/guppy-colour-learning-project/blob/main/methods.Rmd)
file and the home page is built from the
[index.Rmd](https://github.com/wyatt-toure/guppy-colour-learning/blob/main/index.Rmd)
file.

## Metadata

Data are available in the `data/` directory.

Below I provide the variable descriptions for the dataset and the [packages required](#required-tools-and-references) to conduct the analyses and construct the website as well as their versions and citations.
