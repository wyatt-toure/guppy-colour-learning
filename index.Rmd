Welcome to the project site for the experiment described in the manuscript
'Colour biases in learned foraging preferences in Trinidadian guppies'. This
site contains detailed protocols and sample videos for the experiment as well as
the code, model outputs, data tables, and residual diagnostics for the analyses.
The R markdown scripts to reconstruct this site are available at the [GitHub
repository for this
site.](https://github.com/wyatt-toure/guppy-colour-learning-project)

The goal of this project was to determine whether we could shift the preference
for particular objects in Trinidadian guppies regardless of the object's colour,
in this case we focused on green and blue. To address this we performed two
experiments where we rewarded guppies for feeding from either green or blue Lego
blocks, you can see the detailed protocol involved in performing this experiment
as well as example footage of this in the [Protocols](protocols.html) section.
The analysis and the code for the two experiments underlying this project can be
found in the sections [Analysis 1](analysis-experiment-1.html) for experiment 1
and [Analysis 2](analysis-experiment-2.html) for experiment 2.
